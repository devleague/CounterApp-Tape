# Counter App

## Code Calisthenics

Example app that demonstrates how to test an express api using [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)

clone and run `npm i` to install dependencies

then start the app or run the tests

```
npm start
```

```
npm test
```

```
npm test-watch
```

_Notice: tape is based on a standard of testing, though the DevLeague standard is to use mocha and chai_
